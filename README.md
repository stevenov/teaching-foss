# Free and Open Source Software Lesson

This lesson is designed for late high school/early college students. It was given to Summer Youth students working in the Library. It's a bit dense and technical, but I think/hope it's the start of something useful. It should take around 30 minutes.

## Assets

This lesson includes:

* A reading on free and open source software that students read in-class prior to the lesson. It's based [on this article](https://opensource.com/resources/what-open-source).
* The Markdown for the slides used. I like Hacker Slides.
* The rough lesson plan, with timings.

### Tips

* Get students talking/thinking in terms of their phones and apps and use that as the intellectual pivot point
* Bring the lesson around to the reading toward the end
* Privacy/surveillance seemed to resonate
